# OpenE8

OpenE8 has set itself the task of standardising the exchange of administrative data in the education sector. We are still at the very beginning, all details on [this website](https://openpotato.github.io/opene8/).

## Documentation

The documentation website is part of this repository. We have implemented it using [MkDocs](https://www.mkdocs.org) and [Material for MkDocs](https://squidfunk.github.io/mkdocs-material). It is published under https://openpotato.github.io/opene8/.

## Can I help?

Yes, that would be much appreciated. OpenT8 is currently a draft. We are open for any feedback! Use the Issue Tracker for asking and/or submitting a Pull Request.
